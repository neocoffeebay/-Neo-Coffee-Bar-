# -Neo-Coffee-Bar-
NEO COFFEE BAR opened in August of 2015. Located in St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood on Frederick Street and open 7 days a week, it is the perfect spot to sit and catch up on the dayâ€™s news while enjoying your caffeine fix. We are neighbours with schools and big offices alike, and we make everyone feel like they have a community space to share. We look forward to making NEO COFFEE BAR your new local.
